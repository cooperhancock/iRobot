# iRobot
 
This project is an over-development of a coding assignment from an intro CS course. The project implements what was the basic requirement of a "robot" that could be moved to a "goal", with a mode for very basic level pathfinding to the "goal" in a gridded plane. Extras demostrated in the code include:

* command line arguments
* command line loading bars
* teleop mode using basic threading

Code is meant to work on Windows machines, some of the code may break on Unix machines.
